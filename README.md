## Contributions
If you feel like helping me with this project, I will appreciate that. Fork, have fun and make pull requests!

## Possible issues:
  1. You must have in the repo directory to use it => I'm working on to make it easier to use from anywhere; On linux just create an alias, on windows and Mac still don't know
  2. Other ones are not found yet, if you found one, open an Issue 
## Working, but bugs are expected
